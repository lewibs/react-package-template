# HOLY SMOKES THEY DONT MAKE THIS EASY.
Anyways. Here is a template for making this easy :)

## There are two commands.
### npm run test
This runs the program like a normal react aplication and shows the Test component in the viewport. You can edit this with your components to see them in use and test them out.

### npm run build
This takes the lib dir and and runs a bable build on it then places it in dist. From here you can do npm publish and it will make its way to npm. 
ps. don't forget to update the package.json

## there are three places to edit
### lib
This is the directory that holds all your components.

### index.js
This is where you export your lib components. There is an example in here with a basic component. Just replace this.

### package.json
Throw in all your personal info in here.
